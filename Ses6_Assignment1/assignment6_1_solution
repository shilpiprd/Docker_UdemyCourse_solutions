#go to the direcotry in which my_yml file is present 
docker compose -f my_yml.yml up
#now go on google, localhost:8080, now install drupal the standard way, 
#while setting up DB, username: postgres (by default) , name: postgres(by default), under advanced setting, change from localhost to whaterver name uve given.
docker compose -f my_yml.yml down -v
#this would clean up and remove all the unnecessary volumes as well.
