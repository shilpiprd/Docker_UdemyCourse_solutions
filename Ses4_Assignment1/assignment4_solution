#The Dockerfile you create will include instructions to use the official Node.js image from Docker Hub as the base image, which will have Node.js installed in it.
docker build -t shilpiprd/nodejs
docker container run -p 80:3000 --rm shilpiprd/nodejs
#now go over onto ur browser, type localhost and you'll find your work. 
#i built Dockerfile correctly.
#now we gotta make sure that our iamge is tagged correctly so as to be able to push it to our repo.
docker image tag --help
#Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE: basically tag ur image properly
docker image tag shilpiprd/nodejs:latest shilpi06/testing-node
#now if u do: 
docker image ls 
#it'll show that the top 2 lines have the same image id again. 
docker login 
cat .docker/config.json #you probably wouldn't have to do this again, 
docker push shilpi06/shilpiprd/nodejs:latest 

#now if anywhere along the path, you felt like u could've made ur Dockerfile better, 
#just change the dockerfile, do docker build -t <shilpi06/shilpiprd/nodejs> #or maybe u can give whatever name u want, 
#then start a container from that tag name, and see if its working. 
#then u might wanna retag it to make it ready for pushing, docker image tag <initial_name:latest> <final_tag:latest>
#now we'll remove the image and pull it to make sure it's all working correctly
docker image rm shilpi06/testing-node  #this is us removing from local machine
docker container run --rm -p 80:3000 shilpi06/testing-node
