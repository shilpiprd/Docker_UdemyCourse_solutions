cd ~/Documents/Coding/Docker_Assignments/Ses5_Assignment1

#VOLUME /var/lib/postgresql/data (found from docker hub)
docker logs my_postgres 
docker volume ls
#you should see ur volume there, 
docker container stop my_postgres
#we need to change version in both containers, 
docker container run -d --name my_postgres_2 -v $(pwd)/my_pos_db:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:9.6.2
docker logs my_postgres_2 
#here logs is only 4-5 lines.
#the logs shuld only have a couple of lines of startup since it doesn't need to do all the work of initial startup.
#this is kinda how u know that u're using the same named volume, coz the 2nd time it starts up, you'd only have like 4-5 log entires.
docker volume ls 
#it still just shows my_pos_db
