docker container run -it --name my_ubuntu ubuntu:14.04 bash.
apt-get update && apt-get install curl
curl --version
exit 
sudo docker container ls #doesn't give anything

#in terminal2: 
docker container run -it --name my_centos centos:7 bash 
yum update curl
curl --version
exit 
sudo docker container ls #doesn't print anything

#We didn't see any option on sudo docker ls coz none of the containers are running at the moment, they're in stopped state. 
#this is verifiable if we do: 
sudo docker ps -a 
#this would show all containers whether running or stopped.
#these containers can be properly killed by doing: sudo docker rm <container_name_or_id>
sudo docker rm my_ubuntu my_centos
